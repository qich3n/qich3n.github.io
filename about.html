    <h1>About Qi Chen</h1>

    <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying computer science in my final year. I am interested in software development and artificial intelligence, but am also open to exploring different fields while also learning new technologies. At the moment, I have experience with Java, Python, and C#, but am actively trying to expand my experience with other languages. With my experience in programming, I can bring new perspectives and approaches to solving problems.</p>
